# Lovelace RPi Monitor Card

![Project Maintenance][maintenance-shield]

[![License][license-shield]](LICENSE)


If you have a number of Raspberry Pis on your network then this might be the card you need to setup your Dashboard for monitoring all of you RPi's.

### Where to get the sensor software

Please visit my RPi Monitor project for the software needed to send the data to Home Assistant from each of your Raspberry Pi's. [See [RPi Reporter MQTT2HA Daemon](https://github.com/ironsheep/RPi-Reporter-MQTT2HA-Daemon).]

## About this card

This is a Lovelace card showing you the status of one of the Raspberry Pi's on your network.  This card delivers a choice of smaller 'glance' style card or the large 'details' card.  You choose which you'd like for each of your RPi's.

This card is currently in development.  Our design goal is that the cards (glance, large) should look like this:
